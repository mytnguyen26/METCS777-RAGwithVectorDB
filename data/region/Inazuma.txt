Inazuma (Japanese: 稲妻 Inazuma) is one of the seven regions of Teyvat. It is an archipelagic region that worships Raiden Shogun, the Electro Archon and God of Eternity — who is also the leader of its governing body, the Inazuma Shogunate. Inazuma is located approximately 4 km southeast from Liyue Harbor and closely neighbors the Dark Sea.[2]

Archon Quest Chapter II takes place in this region.

Inazuma history

The New World
Main article: Timeline § The New World
400 years after the Primordial One appeared ― The region of Enkanomiya was part of the single, unified human civilization which spanned the whole world.[1][2]
Second Throne of the Heavens ― The war between the Primordial One and the Second Who Came ravages the heavens and earth. Enkanomiya falls into the depths of the ocean and is severed from the surface world.[1][3]
Divine Envoy Era
Note: It is currently assumed that the Divine Envoy Era occurred after the Second Throne of the Heavens since Enkanomiya, which fell during that conflict, is said to have minimal influence from divine envoys.[2]

Enkanomiya
The people of Enkanomiya clash with the Dragonheir of the Depths, vishaps who fled into the ocean depths after the Primordial One defeated the Seven Sovereigns of the old world. Because there was no light in the ocean depths, the vishaps had a great advantage.[1]
Istaroth, the undying wind and presumably one of the Primordial One's four shining shades, is the only one who does not forsake the people of Enkanomiya,[1] as they are able to detect her undying wind from the depths of the ocean.
The sage Aberaku (originally known as Abrax) builds the Dainichi Mikoshi (which he dubbed "Helios"), creating artificial light to drive away the vishaps. It is believed that Istaroth granted Abrax wisdom.[1][4]
1 year after the Dainichi Mikoshi's construction ― People attempt to find the way back to the surface, but are unable to. They interpret this as a ban from the Primordial One, and that meant the Primordial One had defeated the Second Who Came.[1][4]
? years ago ― A cabal of corrupt nobles[5] manipulates the people of Enkanomiya into worshipping the Dainichi Mikoshi as a god, and chose a child to be the Sunchild and rule over the land.[6] The Sunchildren were puppet rulers controlled by these nobles. Abrax, and later Spartacus (Supada no Hiko), opposed the corrupted nobles only to be imprisoned by the Sunchildren.[1][5]
Other Islands of Inazuma
Note: It is unclear when the following civilizations existed, so they have been tentatively placed under the Divine Envoy Era.

A civilization in Tsurumi Island was built and had connection with Celestia. A similar civilization was found beneath Seirai Island.
? years ago ― In the area that is now north of Mt. Yougou, Narukami Island, a kingdom built on sand had a foolish ruler who wanted to build a high garden in honor of the white sakura tree. The kingdom was swept away by floods.[7]
? years ago ― A great flood ravaged the land, leaving only a few islands left.[8] These islands are likely Narukami Island, Kannazuka, Yashiori Island, Seirai Island, and Tsurumi Island. (Watatsumi Island was created by Orobashi towards the end of the Archon War, and therefore does not exist yet.[9])
Pre-Archon War
? years ago ― The Tanuki, creatures native to Inazuma, evolve and gain sentience. The Kitsune immigrate from mainland Teyvat and attempt to colonize the islands, instigating a war between the Tanuki and Kitsune over control of Inazuma.[10][Note 1]
1600 years later ― The Tanuki-Kitsune War finally comes to an end after 1600 years of fighting after negotiating a truce. The Tanuki refuse to admit a loss in the war but cede the "giant Thunder Sakura" (likely the Sacred Sakura) to the Kitsune. Over the course of the war, the tanuki and kitsune's constant transformations and trickery lead members of both groups to become confused on their original identities and allegiances; this resulted in the emergence of humans.[10]


Tsurumi Island
? years ago ― The civilization on Tsurumi Island comes to an end through unknown means.
? years ago ― An eagle known as the Thunderbird spots a fog-covered Tsurumi Island and decides to make its home there. At some point, objects fall from the heavens — possibly the Divine Nail[Assumption 1] —, one of which lands on Tsurumi Island. This temporarily clears up the fog, only for the fog to return in even greater force later.[11]
Humans on the island begin gathering the Thunderbird's shed feathers and worship it, but the bird does not think much of them. The people learned to use Maushiro to locate each other amidst the fog, and they feared and worshipped the eagle. However, the Thunderbird paid them no heed, seeing them as no different from other animals.[11]
The Archon War (?–2000 years ago)
~2000 years ago ― The twin gods Raiden Makoto (Baal) and Raiden Ei (Beelzebul) slay all other gods in the Inazuma region. Ei, although the stronger fighter, believed Makoto to be better-suited for the role of Archon and sacrifices her body so Makoto can ascend to Celestia. Makoto becomes the first Electro Archon, the God of Eternity[12][Note 2][Lore Discrepancy 1]
Makoto uses her new powers to recall Ei's divine will and reforge her body. Ei becomes her kagemusha (body double),[12][13] and most people in Teyvat gain the impression that there was only one god, Baal (also referred to as the Narukami Ogosho, Raiden Shogun).[Note 3]
~2000 years ago[Assumption 2] ― Orobashi flees from an unknown region to the nation of Byakuyakoku, specifically The Serpent's Bowels. It stayed there for a while until a child from the underground nation found it and asked it to become their gods. Together they fought the Sunchild's reign and came out victorious,[4][14] after which it became known as "Orobashi no Mikoto" and the "Watatsumi Omikami" (Great God of the Oceans).[15]
It is supposed that the ban placed by the Primordial One must have been weakened to allow Orobashi to fall to Byakuyakoku.[3]
Orobashi supposedly stayed with the people for a while before leading them back to the surface. It used its power to bolster the Dainichi Mikoshi to have stronger light, and eliminate the threat of the Dragonheir of the Depths.[4][16] It also supervised the research of the Dragonheirs, now called Bathysmal Vishaps.[17]
The Divine Priestess was chosen among the sea-daughters who collected pearls,[18] and was likely the origin of the Sangonomiya Clan. Other clans like the Yuna Clan also originated from Enkanomiya.
Orobashi had its people adapted to Narukami's language and culture to be prepared for a new life above the sea.[17]
Orobashi creates Watatsumi Island out of the coral that grew from its body, allowing them to live above the surface once more as part of the Inazuma archipelago.[9]
On the last day of Enkanomiya before the people relocated above the sea, envoys from Khaenri'ah along with a Ruin Guard came and stole the book Before Sun and Moon, a book that Orobashi personally placed a ban. Antei fought them and prevented the loss of the book, but was also critical injured.[19]
Orobashi's people call this land Sangonomiya, and themselves the Sangonomiya Clan. They begin calling Byakuyakoku, "Enkanomiya," to contrast it with Sangonomiya.[14]
? years ago ― The Kitsune Saiguu is born in the Hakushin Lands.[20][Assumption 3]
The Kitsune Saiguu and the bake-danuki Ioroi often compete with each other. One day, Saiguu decides to trick both Ioroi and Baal at the same time: she challenges Ioroi to pluck a Naku Weed from the Tenshukaku gardens. When Baal catches him in the act and nearly kills him for it, Saiguu comes to his rescue and persuades Baal into not only sparing him, but also putting him under her command as the Hidden Protector of the Grove, the protector of Chinju Forest.[21][22]
? years ago ― The Sacred Sakura grows from "her" body after "her" death;[23] at this point, the tree does not have a fox-like appearance.[24]
Above is the knowledge of people (excluded Ei) who lived before and in the cataclysm. The true Sacred Sakura was not planted until the present.[25]
A ritual involving the worship of both the Raiden Shogun and Orobashi is developed. This ritual must be performed before starting any other ritual. The Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual is also developed at some point, presumably after the aforementioned ritual.[26]
The Thunder Sakura are planted across Narukami Island, using branches of the Sacred Sakura and parts of the Electro Archon's own spirit, to absorb filth from the land.[26][27][28]
~2000 years ago[Assumption 2] ― After Watatsumi Island's infertile land leads to years of famine and disease, Orobashi reluctantly agrees to the Watatsumi people's plan to invade and conquer part of Yashiori Island. A brutal war erupts between Watatsumi and the Narukami Shogunate, led by Ei, which ends with Orobashi slain and Watatsumi's major figures either dead or Missing in Action.[29]
Major figures on the Narukami side, not including Ei:
The Great Tengu Sasayuri, Ei's lieutenant. He is slain during battle, likely against Akuou, who had sought a "joyful" duel against him.
Major figures on the Watatsumi side, not including Orobashi:
The shrine maiden Mouun was particularly skilled in the Yuna Clan's whale-songs and employed the aid of a massive whale. She taught Akuou and was close to him. During the war, she and her whales were ambushed and killed by Sasayuri's subordinates, and their bodies were taken away by the Shogunate.[30]
"Umigozen" Ayame, Mouun's twin sister. She was the general of the Watatsumi navy, and disappeared in the midst of battle with her fate left unconfirmed.[30]
The "Viceroy of the East" Akuou, also known as Touzannou, was found as an orphan and taken in by Orobashi, and later trained under Mouun. He conquered one of the mountains on Yashiori Island, which the Watatsumi people called "Touzan" (Eastern Mountain), and built the Formation Estate on top of it. He was ultimately slain alongside Orobashi when Ei used her ultimate technique, Musou no Hitotachi.[31][32][33]
Some believe that Orobashi participated in this war, despite oracles of its inevitable failure, due to an order from Celestia.[29]
It was revealed that since Orobashi had contacted with the people of Enkanomiya, both Orobashi and Watatsumi as a whole were found guilty of four counts of profanity and eight counts of deceiving living souls. Orobashi was allowed to take all of their transgressions on itself and sacrifice itself so its people would be spared and taken under the rule of Celestia once again.[2]
The Tatarigami supposedly spawned after the death of Orobashi in Yashiori Island. Ei created wards called Narukami Pillar to suppress the soul of Orobashi, hence subduing the Tatarigami, while the Yashiori Guardians led by the Kitain Clan also took up the mantle of suppressing the Tatarigami.[34][35][36]


Tsurumi Island (The Archon War)
<2,600 years ago[Assumption 4] ― Ruu is born among the people of Tsurumi Island and makes preparations to participate in the rituals to the Thunderbird. While practicing his singing, the Thunderbird overhears him and is captivated by the sound of his song. Ruu attempted to befriend the god and give her the name "Kanna Kapatcir," as the Thunderbird had forgotten her own name. They promised to meet each other again in the future.[11]
However, as the situation on the island worsened and many islanders left only to never return — which people took as a sign that they had died, when in actuality they had settled onto the other islands of Inazuma — Ruu volunteered to be sacrificed, believing this would please the Thunderbird and bring the missing people back. Instead, she becomes enraged upon witnessing his death, viewing his sacrifice as the killing of innocents and a promise broken, and retaliates by destroying the area and killing the entire tribe. To hear Ruu's singing again, she uses her powers to cause a ley line disorder, resulting in the entire island continuously reliving its day of destruction.[11][37] Afterward, the Thunderbird flies over to Seirai Island.[11]
After Orobashi's death[Assumption 5] ― Kanna Kapatcir was hunted down and killed as a "monster"[37] at Seirai Island by Raiden Ei, who viewed the Thunderbird as an "obstacle to progress."[24] The remnants of her power were sealed at Asase Shrine, where they formed a coagulation of regret known as the Thunder Manifestation.[38] Wards are set up across the island, including one at Asase Shrine, to keep the Thunderbird's power at bay.[11][39]
Post-Archon War (2000–500 years ago)
2000 years ago — The Archon War comes to an end as the final divine seat in Celestia is claimed, cementing the positions of The Seven's original members.[40][41] Defeated gods who refused to live under The Seven's rule fled to islands in the Dark Sea, where they became evil gods.[42]
? years ago ― The unnamed author of New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune is born in the Hakushin Lands.[43][Assumption 6]
? years ago ― The Kitsune Saiguu moves from the Hakushin Lands to the Grand Narukami Shrine.[20]
At some point in time, the Kitsune Saiguu defeats the Great Tengu in a race, and the Great Tengu becomes her bodyguard thereafter.[21]
? years ago ― The kitsune Yae Miko is born in the Hakushin Lands.[Assumption 6] She eventually moves to Grand Narukami Shrine out of admiration for the Kitsune Saiguu.[20]
Pre-Cataclysm (>500 years ago)
? years ago ― Mikoshi Nagamasa is adopted into the Mikoshi Clan by the oni Mikoshi Chiyo.[44]
? years ago ― Asase Hibiki moves from the Asase Shrine to the Grand Narukami Shrine to receive training.[45]
Asase Hibiki, Mikoshi Nagamasa, and Kamuna Harunosuke receive training from the Yougou Tengu and thereafter become known as "The Yougou Three."[46] Hibiki learns "true magic" from the Tengu.[47]
? years ago ― Takamine the Mistsplitter challenges the Great Tengu to a duel, which ends in a tie. In exchange for the Tengu's bow, Thundering Pulse, Takamine becomes her servant for several years and resides in the Grand Narukami Shrine. He learns some of their archery and swordsmanship and becomes a renowned swordsman himself.[48] Feeling that his archery skills were going to waste, he teaches Hibiki his techniques.[45][49]
? years ago ― The kitsune Urakusai writes the original Chronicles of the Six Kitsune.[43]
~500 years ago ― Urakusai does something that greatly angers the Kitsune Saiguu, leading her to banish him. What he did is no longer clear, but it may relate to the Abyss' invasion of Teyvat during the cataclysm.[20]
After Urakusai's banishment, the Kitsune Saiguu moves from the Grand Narukami Shrine to Tenshukaku in preparation for the Abyss' attack.[20]
The Cataclysm (500 years ago)
Main article: Cataclysm
Monsters from the Abyss invade the aboveground world of Teyvat, causing widespread devastation.[50]
The people of Teyvat attribute the creation of these monsters to a "great sinner," Gold,[50][51] also known as Albedo's master and mother Rhinedottir.[52] Her creations, the Alfisol were the advance guard for the monsters from the Abyss[53]
The Kingdom of Khaenri'ah is destroyed by the Heavenly Principles,[24] causing the fall of the Eclipse Dynasty and the entire civilization.[51] Khaenri'ah's destruction causes a devastating ripple effect.[54]
The Seven become involved in Khaenri'ah after the Abyss' invasion of Teyvat.[24][Assumption 7]
Takamine the Mistsplitter and Mikoshi Chiyo are among those who campaigned alongside Ei (acting as the Raiden Shogun) against the dark forces that emerged during the cataclysm.[45][55]
Takamine is eventually overwhelmed by the monsters and disappears, despite his determination to return to Asase Hibiki's side.[56]
Chiyo is swallowed whole by a "beast of sin" with a tiger's body and a snake's head. Though she manages to tear the beast apart from the inside out, she is stained by its deep sin.[57]
? years ago ― Chiyo turns her blade on Ei, only to be defeated and driven away. This betrayal tarnishes the Mikoshi Clan's reputation.[57]
Over time, the tale of "Chiyo the Tiger-Bite" would evolve into that of Torachiyo, a male lieutenant of Baal's.[55][58][Lore Discrepancy 2]
? years ago ― The Kitsune Saiguu is consumed by the dark forces and most of her memories are dissolved into filth.[21] The uncorrupted remains of her memories eventually manifest as Hanachirusato.[59]
During Khaenri'ah's destruction ― Makoto leaves Ei behind to defend Inazuma, and Makoto alone goes to Khaenri'ah, where she is slain.[24][25]
When Ei arrives to Khaenri'ah, she finds Makoto dying in her arm. She enters Makoto's mind and hears Makoto's last word. Ei decides to save Makoto's realm of consciousness and bring it back to Inazuma.[60]
When Ei returns to Inazuma, she finds that the Sacred Sakura miraculously appears at the top of Mt. Yougou, although according to everyone else, the Sacred Sakura has existed for ages. Ei eventually accepts that the tree is the result of the miracle surrounding Makoto's consciousness while also surmising its sudden growth was the work of Istaroth, one of the Four Shades.[60]
The Sacred Sakura's power help Ei to overcome the monsters and quell the disaster in Inazuma.[60]
Post-Cataclysm (500–100 years ago)
After the cataclysm ― Ei officially takes up the position of Electro Archon after Makoto's death. As she was Makoto's kagemusha and adopted Makoto's titles as her own, most are unaware of the original Archon's death.[61][62]
Disillusioned with Celestia after witnessing the events at Khaenri'ah,[13][61] and in her grief on the losses she sustained over the course of the cataclysm, Ei decides to attain "eternity" by creating a puppet in her likeness. She first experiments with the technology and creates her first prototype, which takes the form of a young male vessel.[61] After seeing him shed tears after his creation, Ei decides he is too delicate to handle the Gnosis and instead seals his powers and leaves him to live his own life. Now armed with the knowledge of how to create puppets, she makes several other failed products before abandoning her quest to create a new vessel to house the Gnosis entirely.[63]
~400 years ago ― Ei ultimately creates a puppet known simply as "the Shogun," intended to rule Inazuma based on the guidelines for "eternity" she had set. After giving the Shogun the relevant information about herself, Ei discards her physical form to enter the Plane of Euthymia, in which she will meditate for all eternity to stave off erosion.[64][65] Before entering the Plane of Euthymia, she gives her Gnosis to Yae Miko.[61]
The Yougou Three part ways, never to reunite:[46]
Asase Hibiki returns to the Asase Shrine on Seirai Island. She eventually becomes involved in Ako Domeki's rebellion against the Inazuma Shogunate (continue reading below for details).
Kamuna Harunosuke leaves for Liyue to pursue the "more powerful 'way of the adepti.'"[21][46]
Mikoshi Nagamasa, to restore the name of the Mikoshi Clan after Mikoshi Chiyo turned her blade on Ei, joins the Shogunate and becomes an Inspector at Tatarasuna.[44][45]
Mikoshi Michihiro, Chiyo's biological son, goes into seclusion in the forests near Konda Village out of shame over his mother's actions.[49]
The Great Tengu, enraged at her own inability to protect the Kitsune Saiguu, departs from the mortal realm and leaves behind her daughter, Teruyo.[45]
? years ago ― Michihiro meets Teruyo when she finds him in the forest. She bestows him with the name "Iwakura," and he is thereafter known as "Iwakura Michihiro."[49]
13 years later ― During their tenth duel, Michihiro finally catches Teruyo. Teruyo gives him the title "Tengu Victor" and decides to disappear from his life to focus on her responsibilities to her clan.[49]
? years ago ― Takamine the Mistsplitter somehow emerges from the Abyss after disappearing from Teyvat for many years. He encounters Asase Hibiki, whom he still recognizes, but she immediately kills him.[48]
? years ago ― The pirate Ako Domeki Zaemon of Seirai Island leads a rebellion against the Shogunate. Hibiki, who is reminded of Takamine when she sees him, decides to assist his cause and later uses the magic she learned from the Tengu to release the seals over Seirai Island. This releases the lingering hatred of the Thunderbird,[47] whose power — manifesting as a massive Electro storm at the center of the island — fragmented Seirai island and swept both the Shogunate and Ako Domeki's ships far from the island.
The Shogunate evacuates the people of Seirai Island and moves them to Narukami Island. Although the area immediately surrounding Asase Shrine is unaffected by the Thunderbird's hatred, the shrine is left abandoned save for Neko and the other cats residing there.
Iwakura Michihiro develops the Iwakura Art sword style and becomes the sword instructor for the Kujou Clan, receiving the title "Douin."[49][66][Assumption 8]
After Michihiro develops the Tengu Sweeper techniques, a series of Maguu Kenki puppets modeled after his fighting style and memories are created.[67]
? years ago, after the creation of Maguu Kenki ― Ako Domeki defeats a Maguu Kenki doll and steals it for himself.[68] The ship carrying it, however, somehow gets lost and becomes shipwrecked on the Golden Apple Archipelago.[69] While the sailors eventually manage to escape the archipelago alongside the original islanders, the puppet is left behind.
? years ago ― Ioroi, having been tricked by the Kitsune Saiguu into staying away from the conflicts of the cataclysm, believes her to still be playing hide-and-seek. Unable to get her to show herself, however, he begins breaking the kitsune statues around Narukami Island and in one, finds an important-looking comb and steals it. The Shogunate learns of Ioroi's antics and dispatches Harunosuke, who had returned to Inazuma, to deal with Ioroi. Harunosuke seals Ioroi and many of the bake-danuki into stone statues.[22][70]
Sometime later, Harunosuke performs a Minor Cleansing with the help of Hanachirusato.[70]
~400 years ago ― Ei's first prototype puppet awakens in Shakkei Pavilion, having no name for himself and only a feather as proof of his connection to the Raiden Shogun.[71] He is found by Mikoshi Nagamasa's yoriki, Katsuragi, and joins the group consisting of Armory Officer Niwa Hisahide, Inspector Mikoshi Nagamasa, Katsuragi, Kinjiro, Nozomu, and Vice Armory Officer Miyazaki in Tatarasuna.[63] Others in the group refer to him as the "Kabukimono" (Japanese: 傾奇者 meaning "wandering eccentric").
The Kabukimono is well received by the people of Tatarasuna, teaching him various skills, including forging swords. He becomes good friends with the people of Tatarasuna.
Nagamasa forges his crowning achievement, the Daitatara Nagamasa. In their joy, Nozomu makes a painting of the nagamaki while Katsuragi and Kabukimono perform a sword dance.[72]
A Fontaine mechanic, Escher, comes to Tatarasuna to collaborate. He implements some technologies to the Mikage Furnace, but this ended up releasing dangerous Tataragami and poisoning the people of Tatarasuna, and caused the Mikage Furnace to spew lethal doses of Tatarigami.[71][73]
Niwa sends people to Inazuma City for aid from the Shogunate, but none of them returns. Then Kabukimono is sent to Inazuma City for aid, but is rejected by the Shogunate because earlier in the same year, Ei's Shogun has activated and she has entered the Plane of Euthymia. Then Kabukimono asks for help to Yae Miko, who does send aid to Tatarasuna, but they were all shipwrecked. Kabukimono is unaware of this, and considered that the Shogunate had abandoned Tatarasuna.[74]
Meanwhile, Niwa confronts Escher, who then murders Niwa and reveals himself to be Il Dottore.[71] He then, as Escher, lies to the people of Tatarasuna, claiming that Niwa fled Tatarasuna. When Kabukimono returns empty-handed, Escher told him that he has been tasked to disable the furnace, giving him a device to help absorb the miasma. After Kabukimono successfully disables the furnace, Escher reveals that inside the device was "a heart that Niwa took from the chest of one of his men," but in truth, Dottore had taken Niwa's heart and placed it into the device. Kabukimono, horrified of this, grows disdain for Niwa and humans, and leaves Tatarasuna.
With Niwa's disappearance, Nagamasa, the second-in-command, becomes responsible of the events in Tatarasuna. Katsuragi is willing to face capital punishment in place of his master, and thus Nagamasa cleaves Katsuragi with the Daitatara Nagamasa before throwing the blade into the furnace.
Nozomu throws himself into the furnace to save the blade but later dies from the wounds he sustained; Kinjiro afterwards hides the remains of the blade as well as Nozumu's painting in the Arsenal.[72] Both Nagamasa himself and the Daitatara Nagamasa are thereon known as the Katsuragikiri Nagamasa (Katsuragi-Slashing Nagamasa).
After Kabukimono leaves Tatarasuna, he encountered a sickly child who is affected by the Tatarigami, his parents, likely workers of Tatarasuna, died of the same cause. Kabukimono and the child makes a promise to stay together forever.[75] But the child dies young due to the Tatarigami. Kabukimono enraged by this, burned the child's house down.[76] His hatred towards gods and humans grows further.
After the events above, during his wanderings in Inazuma, Kabukimono names himself Kunikuzushi (Japanese: 国崩 lit. "Country Destroyer").
As a result of Scaramouche removing all information about himself from the Irminsul in Inversion of Genesis, various aspects of the Tatarasuna incident and the fall of the Raiden Gokaden are vastly altered. All instances of Kabukimono or Kunikuzushi are entirely removed from history, and is replaced by entirely new characters. Dottore still caused the incident, but there is a "brave swordsmith" of the Hyakume Clan who rushed to the scene. He and Niwa both sacrificed themselves to disable the furnace, but neither of them survived.[77]
At some point, the Sacred Sakura takes on the shape of a kitsune head[24] as a result of the kitsune's care for the Sacred Sakura.[25]
Recent Past (<100 years ago)
~100 years ago ― To enact his revenge against the "bladesmith," Kunikuzushi masterminds the fall of the Raiden Gokaden, eradicating three of the five schools before losing interest in and abandoning his project.[63][78] His revenge involved instigating a famous swordsmith, Akame Kanenaga, to betray Inazuma;[79][80] because swordsmithing and the Raiden Gokaden are viewed as a cultural institution, they were under the jurisdiction of the Yashiro Commission. As a result, their inability to prevent the situation dealt a large blow to the Kamisato Clan.[81]
Yae Miko, predicting that the Kamisato Clan would play a major role in Inazuma's future events, intervened in the Kamisato Clan's judgement before the Raiden Shogun and spared them from punishment.[78]
The Kaedehara Clan's head at that time, Kaedehara Yoshinori, stops doing the smithing due to the fearful of Scaramouche's claim.[82] His son Hisamichi attempts to revive the Isshin Art, but to no avail.[83] Eventually, the Kaedehara Clan's fortune keeps regressing, and when Yoshinori's great-grandson, Kazuha, becomes the head, the clan has collapsed.[84][85]
As a result of Scaramouche removing all information about himself from the Irminsul in Inversion of Genesis, various aspects of the Tatarasuna incident and the fall of the Raiden Gokaden are vastly altered. All instances of Kabukimono or Kunikuzushi are entirely removed from history, and is replaced by entirely new characters. From Kunikuzushi being the one who masterminds the fall of the Raiden Gokaden, instead, a descendant of the "brave swordsmith" of the Hyakume clan is the one who masterminds it. When the descendant got to the Kamisato and Kaedehara clans, they retaliated, and killed the descendant.[77]
30 years ago ― Tejima arrives in Konda Village and settles there, using his vision to protect the villagers from both internal and external threats.[86]
1 year ago ― With the Fatui pulling the strings and manipulating the Tenryou Commission and Kanjou Commission,[87][88] the Shogun suddenly institutes the Sakoku Decree to shut Inazuma's borders and the Vision Hunt Decree — an order to seize all Visions within its borders.[89] Furthermore, since then, no new Electro Visions are known to have appeared, though preexisting Visions can still be used.[90] While Ei is aware that the Fatui are behind this, she does not deem them a threat towards Eternity and does not intervene.
The Sangonomiya Resistance is formed to resist the Vision Hunt Decree. Since then, the Shogunate Army and the Sangonomiya Resistance have been at war, which has halted to a stalemate.
An individual protested against the Vision Hunt Decree by declaring a duel before the throne. However, he lost to Kujou Sara and was promptly executed by the Shogun, but not before his Vision was seized by Kaedehara Kazuha who flees Inazuma after being branded a criminal.[91]
The wards which suppressed Orobashi were destroyed by Orobashi fanatics with the help of Nathan, a Fatui agent who infiltrated the Watatsumi Army.[92] This led to the Tatarigami spreading again.[93]
During the heat of the civil war, the Mikage Furnace began to malfunction, forcing Xavier to erect a safety dome to contain the Tatarigami. Production at Tatarasuna comes to a halt, and the evacuation order for the armory was issued.[73]
Chiori, a aspiring seamstress, departs Inazuma for Fontaine in a hurry.[94][95]
Present (The Traveler's intervention)
The Vision Hunt Decree is abolished due to the joint efforts of the Traveler, Yae Miko, and the Watatsumi Army.[96]
La Signora, the Eighth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, loses the duel against the Traveler, and is executed by the Raiden Shogun.[97]
A ceasefire between the Tenryou Commission and Watatsumi Army is agreed upon by Kujou Sara and Sangononmiya Kokomi, with the Traveler bearing witness to the signings.[98]
The events of Transient Dreams takes place. The Sacred Sakura is planted and transferred to the past, Ei and The Shogun agreed on the new term of Eternity, and the Sakoku Decree was lifted.
Along with Hanachirusato, the Traveler performs the latest Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual at Narukami Island.[99]
Along with Xavier, the Traveler resolves the incident at Tatarasuna, regulates the Tatarigami, and brings Mikage Furnace to function normally.[100]
Following Kaji's instruction, the Traveler fixes numerous wards that were destroyed earlier, thus resolving the Tatarigami lingering in Yashiori Island.[101]
The Traveler helps reseal the Thunder Manifestation in Seirai Island, bringing the end to the storm and Balethunder ravaging the island.[39]
After that, the Traveler investigates and discovers the truth of the fog in Tsurumi Island. They help the spirit of Ruu to fulfill the promise with Kanna Kapatcir, and the spirit of the Thunderbird lifts the curse and fog of Tsurumi Island.[11]
Through the request of Tsuyuko, the Traveler is promoted as Watatsumi's hero to dive into Enkanomiya to retrieve Bloodbranch Coral which helps to stave off the spread of the Holy Soil.[14][102][103]
The retrieval of the Bloodbranch Coral triggers the awaken of the Sangacorallia, Orobashi's second familiars. The Sangacorallia are creatures that break down raw, primitive elemental energy into the milder elemental energy of the human realm.[104]
However, this time the Abyss Order cooperated with the Bathysmal Vishaps, with the Bathysmal Vishaps gaining forces to rescue their imprisoned companions which were used the produce the branch while the Abyss achieve safe passages through Enkanomiya. The relationship collapses soon enough, but the damages are done. The Abyssal energy hinders the effectiveness of this Sangacorallia's awakening cycle, and seemingly there will be no Bloodbranch Coral for subsequent Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri.[104][105]
